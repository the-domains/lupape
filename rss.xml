            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Race to Become the WeChat of the West</h1><p>I remember pitching Kik to investors in 2009. It was the most frustrating experience. Why do you need chat that's just on your phone? Why wouldn't you just use Facebook Messenger? Why not just text? At the time, the West completely underestimated chat. People thought Facebook would rule forever.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sBqswcqz_DAjFym3UV7oMg.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Leading Harvard physicist has a radical new theory for why humans exist</h1><p>Where do we come from? Well, it depends on who you ask. For example, an astrophysicist might say that the chemical components of our bodies were first forged in the nuclear fires of stars. On the other hand, an evolutionary biologist might look at the similarities between our DNA and that of other primates' and conclude we evolved from apes.</p><img src="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/56465c2a2491f9b9008b5110-5432-3025/pia17046_-_voyager_1_goes_interstellar.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Feminismo</h1><p>Como editora de uma revista de cunho feminista para garotas adolescentes, dou entrevistas com bastante frequência. Em todas elas, uma pergunta invariavelmente se repete: "o que você acha dessa nova moda de feminismo?". Pode ter variações, perguntas sobre um tal "feminismo pop", sobre um " novo feminismo", sobre um " feminismo divertido, diferente daquele feminismo chato que a gente conhece".</p><img src="http://pontoeletronico.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ms-magazine.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Reality doesn't exist if you're not looking at it</h1><p>The behavior of a particle changes depending on whether or not someone's looking at it. This is a well known theory in quantum physics. It demonstrates that reality is an illusion and it only exists if we're looking at it. That's a pretty mind-blowing theory right there.</p><img src="https://resize.rbl.ms/image?source=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F2698172%2F1200x600.jpg&size=2000%2C2000&c=leZjaJHd1KTHIkvm"></article>]]></description>
