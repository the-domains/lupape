description: "You have a computer in your pocket. Soon, you'll be able to buy your own jet pack. And you're already part owner of a trillion-dollar space agency that sends robots to faraway worlds. In short, you live in the future. In many ways, it's a future nobody could have imagined (Donald Trump for president?!)."
