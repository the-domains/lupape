description: "The entire world has been reeling since the awful attacks on Paris on Friday night. But one particular Twitter spambot account appeared to predict the multiple terror attacks, days before they actually occurred. On the 11th of November - two days before France's capital was targeted - @PzBooks tweeted: 'BREAKING: Death toll from Paris terror attack rises to at least 120 with 270 others injured.'"
